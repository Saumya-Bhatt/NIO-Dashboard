Used jQuery and Ajax scripts to send and receive data from MySQL database. PHP as server side script and HTML/CSS/JS for interface.

1. Can perform basic CRUD operations on files which can be added locally onto server.
2. Can send and receive updates to and fro from the dashboard and the receiving panel.
3. Work done in version wise.
